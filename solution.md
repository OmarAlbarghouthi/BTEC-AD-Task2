> ## **Visual Studio Code**

## Is Visual Studio Code an IDE?

In contrast, Visual Studio Code can be classed as an integrated development environment (IDE), meaning that developers can write and test code at the same time.

## What is VSCode?

Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor that supports development operations such as debugging, running tasks, and version control. It aims to provide only the tools a developer needs for a quick course of code building and debugging and leaves more complex workflows to more premium IDEs, such as the Visual Studio IDE.

## What is GitLab?

 GitLab is a repository hosting manager tool that is developed by GitLab Inc and is used for the software development process.

 It provides a variety of management through which we can coordinate collaborative workflow for a variety of software development lifecycles. It also allows us to import the repository from Google Code, Bitbucket.


 **In our own project, we will use 3 of the previous 6 tools, they are:**  

 **1- Visual Studio Code.**

 **2- Linux.**

 **3- GitHub.**

______
______

## **Q 2.**

As I mentioned above that we will use 3 tools in our project (VSCode, Linux and GitHub), now I will explain why we will use them.

**Let's get to know the features of these tools.**


> ### **VSCode**

At its core, Visual Studio Code is a lightning-fast source code editor, ideal for everyday use. With support for hundreds of languages, VS Code helps you be productive instantly with syntax highlighting, parentheses matching, auto-indentation, checkboxes, excerpts, and more.
____
> ### **Linux**

Linux is perfect for everyday tasks like browsing, emailing, photo management, financial management, and much more.

***Linux Advantages***

1. Open Source

As it is open-source, its source code is easily available. Anyone having programming knowledge can customize the operating system.

2. Security

The Linux security feature is the main reason that it is the most favorable option for developers. It is not completely safe, but it is less vulnerable than others. Each application needs to authorize by the admin user.

3. Free

Certainly, the biggest advantage of the Linux system is that it is free to use. We can easily download it, and there is no need to buy the license for it.

4. Lightweight

Linux is lightweight. The requirements for running Linux are much less than other operating systems. In Linux, the memory footprint and disk space are also lower.

5. Stability

Linux is more stable than other operating systems. Linux does not require to reboot the system to maintain performance levels. It rarely hangs up or slow down. It has big up-times.

6. Performance

Linux system provides high performance over different networks. It is capable of handling a large number of users simultaneously.

7. Flexibility

Linux operating system is very flexible. It can be used for desktop applications, embedded systems, and server applications too. It also provides various restriction options for specific computers. We can install only necessary components for a system.

> ### **GitHub**

#### **So what are the main benefits of using GitHub?**

1. It makes it easy to contribute to your open source projects.

2. Documentation

By using GitHub, you make it easier to get excellent documentation. Their help section and guides have articles for nearly any topic related to git that you can think of.

3. Showcase your work

Are you a developer and wishes to attract recruiters? GitHub is the best tool you can rely on for this. 

4. Markdown

Markdown allows you to use a simple text editor to write formatted documents. GitHub has revolutionized writing by channeling everything through Markdown: from the issue tracker, user comments, everything.

5. GitHub is a repository

This was already mentioned before, but it’s important to note, GitHub is a repository.
What this means that it allows your work to get out there in front of the public. Moreover, GitHub is one of the largest coding communities around right now, so it’s wide exposure for your project.

6. Track changes in your code across versions

When multiple people collaborate on a project, it’s hard to keep track revisions—who changed what, when, and where those files are stored. GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository.

7. Integration options

GitHub can integrate with common platforms such as Amazon and Google Cloud, services such as Code Climate to track your feedback, and can highlight syntax in over 200 different programming languages.
