|Category | Tool | Tool|
|---------|----------|----------|
|IDE      | Visual Studio Code | PyCharm|
|Operating System | Linux      | Windows|
|Version-control platform| GitHub | GitLab|

> ## **Visual Studio Code**

## Is Visual Studio Code an IDE?

In contrast, visual studio code is classified as an integrated development environment (IDE), which means developers can write and test code at the same time.


## What is VSCode?

A visual studio code is a simplified code editor that supports development processes such as debugging, running tasks, and copy control. It aims to provide only the tools needed by the developer for a rapid cycle of code-building and correction and leaves more complex workflows to more IDE premiums, such as the IDE Visual Studio.

> ## **GitHub**

## What is GitHub?

GitHub, Inc. It is an internet hosting provider for software development and version control using Git. Provides distributed version control and source code management functionality for Git, as well as its own features.

**What is GitHub used for?**

It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

___

> ## **PyCharm**

## Wha is PyCharm?

PyCharm is a (**Python integrated development environment (IDE)**) that provides intelligent code completion, code checking, on-the-fly bug highlighting, and quick fixes, along with automated code rebuilding and rich navigation capabilities. PyCharm provides a wide range of essential tools for Python developers, tightly integrated to create an environment conducive to Python development, web, and data science.


___

> ## **Windows**

## What type of OS is Windows?

Microsoft Windows is also called Windows and Windows OS is a computer operating system (OS) developed by Microsoft to run personal computers (PCs). Featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) for IBM-compatible PCs, the Windows operating system quickly dominated the PC market.


____

> ## **GitLab**

## What is GitLab?

 GitLab is a repository hosting manager tool, it is developed by gitLab Inc and employed in the software development process. It also provides a set of management through which we can coordinate the collaborative workflow of a range of software development lifecycles. It also allows us import the repository from google code and bitbucket.


 **In our own project, we will use 3 of the previous 6 tools, they are:**  

 **1- Visual Studio Code.**

 **2- Linux.**

 **3- GitHub.**

______

## **Q 2.**

As I mentioned above that we will use 3 tools in our project (VSCode, Linux and GitHub), now I will explain why we will use them.

**Let's get to know the features of these tools.**


> ### **VSCode**

At its core, Visual Studio Code is a lightning-fast source code editor, ideal for everyday use. With support for hundreds of languages, VS Code helps you be productive instantly with syntax highlighting, parentheses matching, auto-indentation, checkboxes, excerpts, and more.
____
> ### **Linux**

Linux is ideal for everyday tasks like browsing, sending email, managing photos, managing finances, and more.


***Linux Advantages***

1. Open Source

Since it is open-source, its source code is easily available and anyone with software knowledge can customize the OS.

2. Security

The feature of Linux security is the main reason why it is the most convenient option for developers. It is not completely safe, but it is less dangerous than others. Each application needs a license from the administrative user.


3. Free

Certainly, the biggest advantage of Linux is that it is free to use. We can download it easily, and there is no need to purchase a license for it.


4. Lightweight

Linux is lightweight. Linux operating requirements are much lower than other operating systems. In Linux, the memory space and disk space are also less.

5. Stability

Linux is more stable than other operating systems. Linux does not require a system restart to maintain performance levels. It rarely hangs or slows down. She has had great times.


6. Performance

Linux provides high performance across different networks. It is able to handle a large number of users simultaneously.


7. Flexibility

Linux operating system is very flexible. It can be used for desktop applications, embedded systems, and server applications as well. It is also provides various restriction options for specific computers. We can only install the necessary components of the system.

> ### **GitHub**

#### **So what are the main benefits of using GitHub?**

1. It makes it easy to contribute to your open source projects.

2. Documentation

With GitHub, you can make it easy to get excellent documentation. Their Help and Guides section has articles on just about any git-related topic you can think of.


3. Showcase your work

If you are a developer and want to attract recruits. Github is the best tool you can count on it for this.

4. Markdown

Markdown allows you to use a simple text editor to write formatted document. GitHub has revolutionized writing by routing everything through Markdown: from issue tracker to user feedback and everything.


5. GitHub is a repository

This has already been mentioned before, but it is important to note that GitHub is a repository. What this means is that it allows your business to be visible to the public. Moreover, GitHub is one of the largest programming community at the moment, so it offers extensive exposure for your project.


6. Track changes in your code across versions

When multiple people collaborate on a project, it can be hard to keep track of revisionsâ€”who changed what, when, and where those files are stored. GitHub takes care of this issue by keeping track of all changes pushed to the repository.


7. Integration options

GitHub can integrate with popular platforms like Amazon and Google Cloud, services like Code Climate to keep track of your observations, and it can highlight syntax in more than 200 different programming languages.

# **Q 3.**

### **Why did we use the 3 tools (VScode, Linux, GitHub) based on our project regarding the underlying problem?**

The main reason for using these tools is to study them and know the difference between them and other tools.

* As for the VS code, we used it because it supports development processes such as debugging, version control, and running tasks.
* As for Linux, linux helps us use old and old computer systems as a firewall, and it is also secure, and it also helps that it is a file server and backup server.
* Finally, GitHub, GitHub helps us save our work on it and also controls versioning and collaboration, and allows us as a group to work together on projects from anywhere.
